                <p>
                   My name is Michael! I grew up in North Carolina and Virginia,
                    but I currently live with my wife in Idaho. I'm currently studying
                    software developement and work as an express writer at a GM car
                    dealership. I love reading, hiking, making things with my hands,
                    and sports! Whether it's Brazillian Jiu Jitsu, Football, or Pickelball,
                    I love to compete!
                </p>

                    <h4>Reading</h4>
                    <p>I like anything fantasy! I love the fuedal era
                        and the stories associated with that period of
                        history. Within a good story for me is a power
                        struggle of good and evil, because every struggle 
                        like that is symbolic of the war between Jesus Christ
                        and Satan. Good stories are good when they reveal a portion
                        of revealed truth.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Hiking</h4>
                    <p>I love hiking at any time during the year. Whether it's
                        snowing in Winter, leaves are falling during a crisp Fall,
                        or the sun is beating down in Summer. If I'm hking with
                        people that I love, it's always a good time. I especially
                        love small sections where you have to climb a little. It makes
                        it seem like more of an adventure!
                    </p>
